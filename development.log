♦ notes on create window with react-router and electron

from main electron file create addWindow function
  if i add a new browser window it will show the window with the router but it will not hace access to the ipc renderer
  (a prebuid file was produced to the root of the project)

  in order to solve that the function will not create a new browser window but instead it will just load the new url that the react router points at.

  that solves the problem but it will not pop a new window 

  • in order to pop a new window use the newBrowserwindow and point to the path of the route created with the react router.
  (have to solve the problem to import the ipc 
  or -- a solution would be to send the data to the app component of the app --HAVE TO TRY THAT--)

  • to open links to the browser
  require("shell").openExternal("http://www.example.com");
